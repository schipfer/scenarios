This tool is programmed to simplify the comparative economic assessment of supply chains based on various densified bioenergy carrier.
In order to run the tool you need the R-Software, additional packages are included in code and will be downloaded automatically.
Unpack the folder, 

How-to-run:

.) BioChainS_Input.xlsx contains all input parameter. Structure of the input data sheets must stay unchanged but data can be modified and/or extended.
.) Open the R-Software and load BioChainS_exe.R 
.) Enter your working directory on the top and execute all lines
.) This will run the various files and produce an output folder with a date-stamp and all graphs & tables as found in the paper
.) Additional: Modify input files (in xlsx) and sensitivities (in BioChainS_calc.R)
.) Additional: Create knowledge, have fun & send us feed-back
